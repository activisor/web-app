        Hello,
    </p>
    <p>
        {{sender}} used <a href="https://activisor.com?source=refer">Activisor</a> to create a schedule and thought
        you might also find our schedule maker useful.
    </p>

    <h4>Who’s it for?</h4>
    <span>It's for organizers of groups that regularly meet, especially when you have a larger group that’s rotating
        through a limited number of seats at a table or players on a court at a time.</span>
    <br><br>
    <h4>What does it do?</h4>
    <span>It will import your contact list and create a live schedule shared with your group’s members using Google
        Sheets. You can then change it however you want.</span>
    <br><br>

    <h4>What’s so special?</h4>
    <span>It achieves equal participation and randomized rotation among group members for a better experience. There's
        no faster way to create such a schedule.</span>
    <br><br>

    <h4>How is it different?</h4>
    <span>It’s quicker and easier to use than other solutions and there’s no subscription commitment, just a small
        one-time fee.</span>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Best regards,<br>
        The Activisor Team
